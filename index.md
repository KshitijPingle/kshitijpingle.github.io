### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    part 3, was the best lab for me because I loved creating a program to be able to play the ASCII animations. I also found it incredible how programmers during the 1950s to late 1980s used ANSI and ASCII forms of art because most computer monitors could not support regular video animations. Another thing I         found interesting was the number of art people had created for ASCII animations. I took some time after the lab to find some cool ASCII art and animations and played them through the program I made for the lab.

* Lab 9

    part 2, was also the lab that I enjoyed after I finished it. I found it remarkable how the lab guided us to make a spell checker as used in applications such as Microsoft Word and Google Docs. I found this lab more challenging than the others because of the number of issues and problems that popped up while my partner and I worked on it. But, this experience gave me more confidence after I finished the lab.
    
* Lab 11

    part 2, is another lab I liked. When we worked on the hilo game in one of the previous labs, I thought that this process should be done using functions because it was so tedious. Although, when we finished this lab, it was an essential reminder of how powerful functions can be. Hence, I enjoyed this lab because of the additions of the header files and because we were improving upon the work we had done in a previous lab to make it cleaner and more efficient.
